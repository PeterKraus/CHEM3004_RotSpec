    "## Section 3: Rotational transitions of menthol \"by hand\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will have seen after sharing your data from the [menthol calculation](02_menthol_calc.ipynb) workbook, the rotational constants of the four stereoisomers differ quite substantially. This is what makes rotational spectroscopy such a powerful method - small changes in the structure affect the spectra a lot!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3.1: Introduction into asymmetric tops\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for linear molecules (eg. N<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>) and spherical tops (eg. CH<sub>4</sub> or SF<sub>6</sub>), the expressions for energy levels are simple: the rotational term $E(J)$ depends only on the rotational quantum number $J$ and the single rotational constant $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E(J) = BJ(J+1)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that the transitions between adjacent energy levels ($J+1\\leftarrow J$) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E(J+1) - E(J) = B(J+1)(J+2) - B(J)(J+1) = 2B(J+1).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the expressions for rotational energy levels are not trivial for symmetric tops and asymmetric tops. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue in asymmetric tops, such as menthol, is further complicated by the fact that the projections of the angular momenta ($K_a, K_c$ or $K_{-1}, K_{1}$) on the axes ($a, c$) are no longer \"perfect\" as the molecule is asymmetric, and therefore no analytical expression exists. Fortunately, the values have been tabulated - we will use one such table from [Gordy and Cook]() which includes most terms up to $J = 5$, where the terms $E(J_{K_a K_c}) = E(J_{K_{-1} K_1})$ are expressed using the rotational constants $A, B, C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![from Gordy and Cook](gordy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the expressions for the terms of $4_{40}$, $4_{22}$ and $4_{04}$ exist, but they are about half a page long each, so they are not shown. As you can see from the above table, the expressions very quickly become too messy to be useful for evaluations by hand."
