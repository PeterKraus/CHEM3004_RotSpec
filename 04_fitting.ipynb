    "## Section 4: Fitting experimental rotational spectrum of menthol\n",
    "\n",
    "This final section contains a set of instructions on how to fit the rotational constants to match the experimental spectrum of menthol. As a starting point of our fit, we will use [your previously calculated](02_menthol_calc.ipynb) rotational constants ($A, B, C$) of the [stereoisomer of menthol you previously identified](03_transitions.ipynb) as the most likely experimental candidate. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fit the spectrum, we will use the program [pgopher](http://pgopher.chm.bris.ac.uk/), which we will first need to set up, and then import the experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will use pgopher to compare the spectrum calculated from the dipole moments and rotational constants to the experimental spectrum, and hopefully you will be able to guess an initial set of transitions to start your fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we should be able to \"float\" the rotational constants so that the difference between the predicted and measured frequencies of transitions are minimised. From this, you should obtain a list of assigned lines (i.e. $J''_{K''_a K''_c} \\leftarrow J'_{K'_a K'_c}$ values and the assigned frequencies) used in this minimisation, as well as the resulting fitted ground state rotational constants. As an additional challenge, you can try to determine the centrifugal distortion constant, which is especially important when predicting transitions involving higher $J$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4.1: Download pgopher and the data\n",
    "Right-click and save-as the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Windows version of the program [pgopher v10.1.183](http://pgopher.chm.bris.ac.uk/download/PgopherU64.exe)\n",
    "- The experimental [spectrum](menthol_2100k_FT.dat)\n",
    "\n",
    "Versions of pgopher for other platforms (Mac, Linux) are available [here](http://pgopher.chm.bris.ac.uk/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4.2: Set up pgopher to allow us to fit the spectra\n",
    "#### 4.2.1: Run the downloaded executable. You will see a window similar to this one:\n",
    "![pgopher window](pgopher_00_empty.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2: Import experimental spectrum:\n",
    "First, change the units on the X-axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Plot -> Units -> MHz`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, import the downloaded spectrum:\n",
    "\n",
    "`File -> Open ->` select the `menthol_2100k_FT.dat` file. You should end up with the experimental spectrum shown in red:\n",
    "![pgopher experimental spectrum](pgopher_01_exp.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.3: Add a calculated rotational spectrum:\n",
    "`File -> New -> Microwave -> Asymmetric Top`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add a new calculated microwave spectrum to the plot. We want to change this prediction to reflect our calculated data for menthol. We need to open the constants window:\n",
    "\n",
    "`View -> Constants`\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the units for our sample are in MHz:\n",
    "![pgopher sample units](pgopher_02_units.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the symmetry group of the species within the sample from `C2v` to `C1`:\n",
    "![pgopher sample symmetry](pgopher_03_C1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the calculated rotational constants $A$, $B$, and $C$ for the selected stereoisomer:\n",
    "![pgopher sample rotcon](pgopher_04_ABC.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the three components of the dipole moment for that stereoisomer. For this, we need to add further cartesian moments under the `<Ground|mu|Ground>` heading. After you're done, the window should look as follows:\n",
    "![pgopher sample dipole](pgopher_05_mu.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, adjust the simulation parameters to sensible values. Our experimental spectrum is recorded between 2100 and 8000 MHz, obtained in a supersonic expansion at temperatures of 1-2 K. Adjust those parameters as shown below:\n",
    "![pgopher sample simulation](pgopher_06_sim.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the main window and click the `Simulate spectrum` button: ![simulate](pgopher_simulate.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see the experimental spectrum in red on the top, and the simulated spectrum in black on the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.4: Assigning transitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can zoom into a certain region of the spectra by first left-clicking and dragging a rectangle around the region, and then clicking the `Change horizontal plot range` button: ![zoom](pgopher_zoom.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to zoom into the 2000 - 4000 MHz range. You should see a spectrum similar to the one showed in [the previous workbook](03_transitions.inpynb) along with some calculated frequencies that are in roughly the same positions. To assign a transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Right click on one of the calculated (black) transitions. A `Lines` window will appear, listing all lines that are in the near vicinity of your right-click (in this case, two lines): ![pgopher lines](pgopher_07_lines.jpg) You are probably interested in the line with the higher intensity (`Strength` column). Note also the last column, which shows the vibrational and rotational state of the calculated line - in our case we only have the vibrational ground state ($v=0$), but two of the transitions are nearby: the $a$-type $3_{13} \\leftarrow 2_{12}$ transition ($\\Delta K_a$ is even, $\\Delta K_c$ is odd), as well as a $c$-type $7_{17} \\leftarrow 6_{25}$ transition ($\\Delta K_a$ is odd, $\\Delta K_c$ is even).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the transition you want to assign is highlighted in the `Lines` window, as shown in the above picture.\n",
    "- In the main window, right-click-and-drag a rectangle around the experimental (red) transition you think corresponds to the calculated one. The last column will now include the filename of the spectrum for the assigned line: ![pgopher assign](pgopher_08_assigned.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the above process for 3-4 transitions in total. Then click the `Fit` button in the `Lines` window. You should see a `Log` window appear: ![pgopher log](pgopher_09_log.jpg) In this case, we have assigned 3 transitions, but all parameters are fixed, so the fit does not change anything. The average error between the predicted lines and assigned experimental lines is shown at the bottom (`Average Error: 31.1125963305`), this is the average of the data in the `Obs-Calc` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.5: Fitting rotational constants:\n",
    "Open the constants window (`View -> Constants`), select the ground state of our molecule (`v=0`) and change the `no` in the `Float` column to `yes` for the rotational constants you want to fit. Note that for a sensible fit of $N$ parameters you need to solve $N$ equations, which means to meaningfully fit $A$, $B$, and $C$ you need to have *at least* 3 transitions, or 4 if you want a measure of error of your fit. It is also important that your chosen transitions contain each of the $A$, $B$, or $C$ terms - for example it would be pointless to try to fit $C$ using the $1_{10} \\leftarrow 0_{00}$ transition, as its energy term ($A+B$) does not contain $C$!\n",
    "\n",
    "After an initial fit, keep adding more transitions. The values in the `Log` window to look at are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Predicted New Error`: This is the overall error of the fit. The value should be well below 0.01 MHz, given the accuracy of the instrument. If the error does not go down, check your line assignments - they may be wrong. Alternatively, you may be assigning higher-$J$ transitions, which include significant centrifugal distortion effects.\n",
    "- `Std Dev` column: This shows the estimated precision of each of the fitted parameters. With about 20 assigned transitions, the $A$ rotational constant can be fitted with precision of around 0.0015 MHz, while $B$ and $C$ can be fitted to 0.0003 MHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are happy with your fitted $A$, $B$, $C$, try to fit the centrifugal distortion constant $\\Delta_J$. This should help with reducing errors in higher-$J$ transitions. You can do this by navigating to the species parameters (`View -> Constants`), and then in the ground state of the molecule (`v=0`) enable `Float` for `deltaJ` and perform the fit. Does the quality of your fit improve or not? How about the standard deviations in $A$, $B$, $C$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4: Think about the following:\n",
    "For your lab report, you will need the data from the log file: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The $A$, $B$, $C$, and if fitted, $\\Delta_J$ parameters are listed near the end of the log file under the `Summary` column. Include those in a table, and compare them to the [published data](https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2015.00015) as well as your calculations from [previous exercises](02_menthol_calc.ipynb). \n",
    "    - How good is your agreement with the published results? \n",
    "    - Why is there such a big difference between the calculations and experiments? \n",
    "    - Is the minimum energy stereoisomer as predicted by theory the experimentally observed isomer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The line list itself. It is customary to attach the list of lines used to determine the above rotational constants into an appendix or supplemental material. The columns of the table should include: $J''_{K''_a K''_c}$, $J'_{K'_a K'_c}$, the observed (experimental) frequency, the fitted (calculated) frequency, and a difference of the two in appropriate units, listed for each line used in the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a comparison of the fitted (calculated) and experimental spectrum can be exported using `File -> Export -> Main Plot`. Here you can export the graph as a `svg` file and attach it to your lab report."
